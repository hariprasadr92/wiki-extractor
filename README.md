# wiki-extractor
Crawls wikipedia pages and extracts the required contents.


I have used Wikipedia's API in this. 
Pass the wikipedia's page name eg. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football -> You should pass Football ( case-sensitive) and the contents will be extracted and dumped into a file that u again configure in the code.


As of now, the details are harcoded as it was just a wiki data scraping project. Might make it better and more usable in the future.
